        <h2>Chapter 1: Before You Start</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Why Learn How to Play the Piano? (5 Reasons)</h3>
        <p>If you're reading this article, you're probably already excited to learn how to play piano! But in case you're not convinced yet, this section is for you üôÇ.</p> <br>
        <p>We think the piano is the best musical instrument to learn. Of course, we're biased as pianists, but there are compelling reasons to pick up piano as your first musical instrument:</p>
        <h4>Reason #1: You can make amazing sounds from day 1</h4>
        <p>Some instruments, like the violin or the trumpet, take skill just to make a decent sound. But piano is rewarding from day 1 because you don't have to ‚Äúmake‚Äù the sound yourself. All you have to do is press a key that's attached to a hammer that hits a string to create a perfectly clear note. Most people can figure out a simple melody on a keyboard by playing around. Of course, there's more to playing piano than eking out ‚ÄúTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star,‚Äù but at least you won't be squeaking through your first few lessons!</p> <br>
        <h4>Reason #2: You learn both melody and harmony, treble clef and bass clef</h4>
        <p>A neat thing pianists can do is play both melody and harmony. Most instruments can't do this. As a pianist, you'll gain a deeper understanding of both melody and harmony ‚Äî that is, both the foreground and background of music.Knowledge of both treble and bass clef also helps. Many instruments only use the treble clef, but if you decide to pick up the tuba later on, that bass clef knowledge will come in handy.</p> <br>
        <h4>Reason #3: You are an independent music-making machine ‚Äî but you can also have fun with other people</h4>
        <p>Since pianos handle both melody and harmony, you don't require someone to accompany you. Other instruments, such as the violin or guitar, require bands, backing tracks, or an accompanying pianist to sound ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù</p> <br>
        <p>But pianists aren't doomed to be alone! Pianos are a pillar instrument in many ensembles, from jazz bands to church worship teams. If you play piano, we encourage you to jam with other musicians. It's a wonderful experience.</p> <br>
        <img src="images/1234-feist.jpg" alt="No image"> <br>
        <h4>Reason #4: Pianos can play practically every musical genre possible</h4>
        <p>Whether it's classical, jazz, blues, boogie-woogie, rock, pop, or experimental avant-garde stuff, the piano can handle them all.</p> <br>
        <p>Now, the skills required for different genres can be very different. But you don't need a whole different instrument (such as going from steel-string to nylon-string guitar) to learn a new genre.</p> <br>
        <h4>Reason #5: Piano knowledge lets you pick up other musical instruments with ease</h4>
        <p>Because piano requires fine motor skills, knowledge of both treble and bass clefs, and good musicality, when you learn piano, you gain transferable skills for other instruments.</p> <br>
        <p>Since learning piano, I've learned flute, electric and acoustic guitar, electric bass, and a few basic drum patterns. I believe these instruments were definitely easier to learn because I had piano skills as a foundation.</p> <br>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Take a Seat</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Good Piano Posture</h3>
        <p>Good habits start from day one. Before you start playing, always stretch, warm up, and check your posture.</p> <br>
        <p>Sit down on your bench facing the middle of the piano. Make sure your feet are flat on the floor, your shoulders relaxed, and your arms are gently bent at the elbow.</p>
        <h4>Remember these posture tips:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't sit hunched over.</li>
            <li>Warm up with a few stretches before each <br> practice session.</li>
            <li>Pay close attention to your wrists, forearms, and <br> shoulders.</li>
        </ul>
        <video muted autoplay loop>
            <source src="images/giphy.mp4">
        </video> <br>
        <p>When you place your hands on the keyboard, relax your wrists. Don't tense your fingers‚Äîkeep them loose so that they're slightly bent, not straight. Be careful not to let your wrists droop.</p> <br>

        <p>Good posture is essential to enjoying your time at the piano. If you're comfortable, you'll be more motivated to practice, and you'll play with better technique too.</p> <br>

        <h2>Chapter 3: Basic Skills</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Keyboard Navigation and Musical Alphabet</h3>
        <p>The piano keyboard may look dizzying with its vast array of keys (88, to be exact). But once you understand the patterns that make it work, it's actually quite simple.</p> <br>
        <h4>How to Find Middle C</h4>
        <p>Take a look at your keyboard. Notice the black keys‚Äîsee how there are sets of two and sets of three? We'll use these sets of twos and threes to find Middle C.</p> <br>
        <video muted autoplay loop>
            <source src="images/C.mp4">
        </video> <br>
        <p>Middle C is the first note you'll learn on the piano. It's smack dab in the middle of the keyboard, usually where the brand name of the piano is.</p> <br>
        <p>Find a set of two black keys in the middle and play the white key on the very left: this is Middle C!</p> <br>
        <p>Remember where Middle C is. You'll use it to orient yourself around the rest of the keyboard.</p> <br>
        <h4>The Musical Alphabet</h4>
        <p>Now for your first theory lesson! In music, we name notes after the alphabet. The white key after C is D, the one after is E, and so on. The musical alphabet stops at G, however, so instead of a note called H we just repeat from C again.</p> <br>
        <img src="images/labelled keyboard.png" alt="No image">
        <p>If you're wondering what all those black keys are called, they're half-steps between the white notes and they're called sharps or flats. We'll cover sharps and flats more in the theory section of this guide.</p> <br>
        <p>Once you understand the musical alphabet, you can move on to the five-finger scale!</p>

        <h3 id="ls4">3.2 How to Play the Five Finger Scale</h3>
        <p>The five-finger scale is a basic skill that will introduce you to a finger movement that is fundamental to piano-playing.</p> <br>
        <h4>The Right Hand</h4>
        <video muted autoplay loop>
            <source src="images/R.mp4">
        </video> <br>
        <p>Let's go back to Middle C. Place your right thumb on Middle C. In piano, we call this finger 1.</p> <br>
        <p>Next, place your index finger on the next white key, D. This is finger 2. Place your remaining fingers on the other white keys. This means finger 3 goes on E, finger 4 goes on F, and finger 5 (pinky) goes on G.</p><br>
        <p>Try playing these notes in order (1-2-3-4-5). Then, play it in reverse (5-4-3-2-1). Congratulations, you've just played your first C major five-finger scale!</p> <br>
        <p>If this feels weird at first, that's totally normal and okay. It's a new movement, so it'll take time to get used to. Your fingers may want to stick together, especially fingers 3 and 4. To improve, challenge yourself to play all five notes as evenly and articulated as you can.</p> <br>
        <p>Play the right-hand five-finger scale a few times. Once you get the hang of it, move on to the left hand.</p> <br>
        <h4>The Left Hand</h4>
        <video muted autoplay loop>
            <source src="images/L.mp4">
        </video> <br>
        <p>Find the C below Middle C and place your left pinky (finger 5) on it. Then follow up with the rest of your left-hand fingers.</p> <br>
        <p>Again, play these notes up and down a few times until it feels more familiar.</p><br>

        <h3 id="ls5">3.3 Your First Chords</h3>
        <p>Chords are the building blocks of music. They're used in most Western music traditions, including pop, jazz, and church songs. Understanding chords will help you progress in piano on both the practical and theoretical fronts.</p> <br>
        <img class="ig" src="images/chord-positions-2x2 (1).png" alt="No image">
        <p>Now, there's a lot of theory behind chords and chord progressions ‚Äî theory that's quite fascinating ‚Äî but to make things simple in this guide, we'll learn four basic chords in their root position and how to move between them. </p> <br>
        <p>The names of the four basic chords we'll learn are: C major, G major, A minor, and F major.</p> <br>
        <img class="ig" src="images/chord-positions-rt (1).png" alt="No image">
        <p>On your right hand, place finger 1 (thumb) on C and finger 5 (pinky) on G. Play these notes together. They are the outer ‚Äúshell‚Äù of the C major root position chord. Once this feels comfortable, try playing E with finger 3 (your middle finger).</p> <br>
        <img class="ig" src="images/chord-positions-lh (1).png" alt="No image">
        <p>Try the same thing on your left hand. Place your left-hand finger 5 on C and finger 1 on G to form the chord shell. Then, play E with finger 3.</p> <br>

        <h3 id="ls6">3.4 Playing with Both Hands</h3>
        <p>Let's get one thing out of the way: playing with both hands feels weird. At least at first.</p> <br>
        <p>Hand independence is something you'll continually work on as a pianist. Even advanced pianists have challenges with hand independence.</p> <br>
        <img src="images/blurry hands.jpeg" alt="No image">
        <h4>The Five-Finger Scale in Both Hands</h4>
        <p>You already know the five-finger scale. Now let's try playing it with both hands.</p> <br>
        <p>When you play the five-finger scale up with both hands, the fingering with look like this:</p> <br>
        <pre>
        Right hand: 1-2-3-4-5 (C-D-E-F-G)
        Left hand: 5-4-3-2-1 (C-D-E-F-G)
        </pre> <br>
        <p>When you play the five-finger scale down with both hands, the fingering will look like this:</p> <br>
        <pre>
        Right hand: 5-4-3-2-1 (G-F-E-D-C)
        Left hand: 1-2-3-4-5 (G-F-E-D-C)
        </pre>
        <p>If this feels easy, try playing loudly in one hand and softly in the other. Then, switch.</p> <br>

        <h3 id="ls7">3.5 Playing Scales With Both Hands</h3>
        <p>If you're curious about scales, now is a good time to start.</p> <br>
        <p>You've mastered the five-finger scale, but what happens when you want to play the entire C major scale, from one octave to the next?</p> <br>
        <p>Unless you master the right technique, you'll run out of fingers! So, before playing hands together, be sure to practice playing a full-octave scale on your right and left hands.</p> <br>

        <h2>Chapter 4: The Grand Staff</h2>
        <h3>4.1 How to Read Music Notation</h3>
        <p>You know the musical alphabet. Now let's learn how to spell some music!</p> <br>
        <p>The first thing you should familiarize yourself with is the grand staff.</p>
        <img class="ig" src="images/grand staff labelled.png" alt="No image">
        <p>Most piano music is written on the grand staff. The grand staff is special to the piano because there's a top and bottom part, usually denoting right and left hands.</p> <br>
        <p>We'll briefly touch on the parts of the grand staff here, but for a more thorough breakdown, we recommend watching this lesson.</p> <br>
        <img class="gb" src="images/treble clef copy.png" alt="No image">
        <p>In general, pianists play notes on the top staff, the one with the treble clef, with the right hand.</p> <br>
        <img class="ga" src="images/bass clef copy.png" alt="No image">
        <p>Notes on the bottom staff, the one with the bass clef, are usually played with the left hand.</p> <br>
        <p>In each staff (treble and bass), there are five lines with spaces between them. This is where our notes sit.</p> <br>
        <img src="images/las.jpg" alt="No image">
        <p>The higher up we move the lines and spaces, the higher the pitch!</p> <br>
        <p>Notes occupy lines and spaces and they all have names. At first, it'll feel intimidating to memorize all the notes and their locations, so these acronyms might help.</p> <br>

        <h3 id="ls9">4.2 Music Symbols</h3>
        <p>You can probably tell that there's a lot more than notes and staves in sheet music. Here are other things you may run into when sight-reading music.</p> <br>
        <h4>Accidentals</h4>
        <p>A sharp means we raise a note up by one half-step. A flat means we lower a note down by one half-step. Therefore, F sharp is the black key immediately right of F, and B flat is the black key immediately left of B.</p> <br>
        <p>A natural tells you not to sharp or flat a note.</p> <br>
        <img src="images/sonata in c - accidentals.png" alt="No image">
        <p>Accidentals are sharps, flats, and naturals outside the key signature that appear in music. The general rule is, if a note has a sharp (or flat, or natural), all instances of that note thereafter in the same measure should also be sharped.</p> <br>
        <h4>Dynamics</h4>
        <p>Dynamics are what makes a good piano performance sound great.</p> <br>
        <p>Dynamics are markings that tell players whether to play something loud, soft, or something in between. Here are some common dynamic markings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forte (f) - loud</li>
            <li>Piano (p) - soft</li>
            <li>Mezzo forte (mf) - medium loud</li>
            <li>Mezzo piano (mp) - medium soft</li>
            <li>Fortissimo (ff) - very loud</li>
            <li>Pianissimo (pp) - very soft</li>
            <li>Crescendo - gradually get louder</li>
            <li>Decrescendo - gradually get softer</li>
        </ul>
